            <p class="read-more-wrap">Everyone knows viruses and trojans are bad, but a lot of people don’t know how exactly they work.<span class="read-more-target highlight"> Viruses, for example, are programs that copy themselves and infect a computer, spreading from one to another—just like, well, a real life virus. Trojans, on the other hand, are applications that look normal, but secretly have code that’s doing something else—like letting someone else control your computer. We highly recommend reading this explanation for more detail on the different types of malware, as well as the biggest myths surrounding them. And, as always, make sure you’re running a good antivirus program—even if you have good browsing habits.</span></p>

          <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-2" />
          <p class="read-more-wrap">You’ve probably heard some people say you should drain your battery completely before charging it, or that you<span class="read-more-target highlight"> should keep it between 40% and 80% all the time to make it last longer. Most of these rules are outdated, applying to older nickel-based batteries. Luckily, most or all of your gadgets these days run on Lithium Ion batteries, which are easy to take care of. We recommend reading our full guide on how they work, but the gist is: they last longer when you perform shallow discharges, keep them cool, and don’t leave them plugged in while they’re running at 100%. Honestly, though, batteries have a finite life no matter what, and your efforts will only go so far—so don’t stress about it. Focus your efforts on getting better battery life out of your iPhone, Android phone, or laptop on a given charge instead—and knowing how to replace the battery when it starts dying.</span></p>

				</div>
				<div class="num-answers">
          <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-3" />
          <p class="read-more-wrap">Most of us put a lot of effort into finding free Wi-Fi, but public Wi-Fi networks have their own share of problems—particularly <span class="read-more-target highlight"> that it’s very insecure. Even if a Wi-Fi network has a password, other people on the network could see what you’re doing, or—if they were so inclinded—steal personal information and passwords. Luckily, there’s a lot you can do to stay safe: make sure sharing is turned off, use HTTPS whenever possible, and run your traffic through a VPN. Follow this guide for the details, and you should be a-okay.</span></p>
